### The task
There is a Java snippet located inside the `java_code` directory.
Your task is to implement the same algorithm in Python.
`data` directory includes the required data file.

### How to
1. Fork this repo
1. Make changes to `python_code/minimizing_lateness.py` (inside `main` function).
1. Send us the link to your cloned repository

### Evaluation
While implementing a correct and robust algorithm is your main task,
we will also evaluate code readability and its compliance with [pep-8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).

### Good luck!
